## The ATM Simulator
The ATM Simulator is a command-line based program written in C++ that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) used for financial transactions. This program allows users to deposit, withdraw, check their account balance and make payments to other banks. It has a simple and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, with error handling features that prevent users from entering invalid input.

To get started with the ATM Simulator, simply compile and run the program on your command-line interface. Follow the instructions on the screen to select the transaction you want to perform and enter the required information.
